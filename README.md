## Background

*Provide security assessments and reports (readiness, initial, annual, and significant change) for systems at potentially all security levels of assessment (LiSaaS, Low, Moderate, and High). These security assessments must meet all of the requirements of a FedRAMP security assessment.

*Provide consulting services to assist systems getting prepared for a FedRAMP security assessment with documentation assistance and system architecture guidance.
